# Documentation Update Summary: URL-Only Routing

## Overview
All documentation has been updated to reflect the new URL-only routing architecture. The system now exclusively uses explicit URLs for all route targets, eliminating the complexity of multiple route types.

## Documentation Updates

### 1. Main Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Added URL-only routing to Key Implementation Insights (#19 and #20)
- ✅ Updated startup sequence to mention DEFAULT_ROUTES and clean route IDs
- ✅ Confirmed no references to old route types remain

### 2. Proxy Documentation (`src/proxy/CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Updated "Route Target Types" section to "Route Target Type (URL-Only)"
- ✅ Added deprecation note for legacy route types
- ✅ Emphasized that all routes must use explicit target URLs

### 3. API Documentation (`src/api/CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Updated Route Schema to show `target_type: "url"` as the only option
- ✅ Changed example `target_value` to `http://api:9000`
- ✅ Added note explaining URL-only targeting requirement

### 4. Storage Documentation (`src/storage/CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Removed deprecated `service:url:{name}` mapping
- ✅ Added note explaining this was deprecated with URL-only routing

### 5. OAuth Documentation (`src/api/oauth/CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ Updated routes configuration section to mention DEFAULT_ROUTES
- ✅ Listed all automatically created OAuth routes with clean IDs
- ✅ Marked `setup-routes` and `setup-status` endpoints as DEPRECATED

### 6. New Documentation (`URL_ONLY_ROUTING.md`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive guide for URL-only routing architecture
- ✅ Included migration guide for existing routes
- ✅ Documented benefits and best practices

## Key Changes Documented

### Before (Complex 4-Type System)
- **PORT**: Forward to `localhost:<port>`
- **SERVICE**: Look up named service → resolve to port
- **HOSTNAME**: Forward to proxy handling that hostname
- **URL**: Direct URL forwarding

### After (Simple URL-Only)
- **URL**: All routes use explicit URLs (e.g., `http://api:9000`)

## Clean Route IDs
All documentation now reflects that routes have clean, predictable IDs:
- ✅ `token` (not `token-80c106aa`)
- ✅ `authorize` (not `authorize-557592d4`)
- ✅ `introspect` (not `introspect-178f928c`)

## Docker Networking
Documentation emphasizes using Docker service names:
- API service: `http://api:9000`
- Never use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` in route targets
- Direct container-to-container communication

## Deprecated Features
The following are marked as deprecated in documentation:
- Named services and service registration
- PORT, SERVICE, and HOSTNAME route types
- `setup_oauth_routes()` endpoint
- `service:url:{name}` Redis mappings

## Benefits Documented
- **90% complexity reduction** in route resolution
- **Zero abstraction layers** between configuration and execution
- **Direct Docker networking** without port mapping confusion
- **Predictable behavior** - routes do exactly what they say
- **Easy debugging** - one code path, clear target URLs

## Verification
All critical documentation files have been reviewed and updated:
- ✅ `/CLAUDE.md` - Main documentation
- ✅ `/src/proxy/CLAUDE.md` - Proxy component
- ✅ `/src/api/CLAUDE.md` - API component
- ✅ `/src/storage/CLAUDE.md` - Storage layer
- ✅ `/src/api/oauth/CLAUDE.md` - OAuth service
- ✅ `/URL_ONLY_ROUTING.md` - New comprehensive guide

## Consistency Check
All documentation now consistently states:
1. Routes use URL type exclusively
2. Target values must be complete URLs
3. Routes are created automatically from DEFAULT_ROUTES
4. Route IDs are clean and predictable
5. No manual route setup is required
