2. **Set 1-hour defaults** - All commands now default to 1 hour lookback
3. **Fixed logs-follow** - Corrected response parsing in proxy-client
4. **Added missing endpoints** - Created API endpoints for user, session, method, status, path, slow queries
5. **Removed TLS logging** - Cleaned up non-implemented TLS handshake logging code
