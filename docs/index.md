# ACME Certificate Manager

Welcome to the ACME Certificate Manager documentation!

## Overview

ACME Certificate Manager is a pure Python HTTPS server that automatically obtains and renews TLS certificates via the ACME protocol. It provides a complete solution for certificate management with these key features:

- **Zero-downtime certificate updates** through hot-reloading
- **Redis-exclusive storage** - no filesystem persistence
- **Multi-domain certificates** with SNI support
- **Automatic renewal** before expiry
- **RESTful API** for management
- **Docker-ready** deployment

## Why ACME Certificate Manager?

### Problem

Managing HTTPS certificates is complex:
- Manual certificate generation and renewal
- Service restarts cause downtime
- Certificate files scattered across filesystem
- Complex nginx/Apache configuration
- No centralized management

### Solution

ACME Certificate Manager solves these problems:
- **Automatic**: Certificates generated and renewed automatically
- **Zero-downtime**: Hot-reload certificates without restarts
- **Centralized**: All data in Redis, manageable via API
- **Simple**: Just point your domains and go
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling with shared Redis
