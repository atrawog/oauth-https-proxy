    failure_reason: |-
      Session persistence is not properly implemented.

                  The server must:
                  1. Accept valid session IDs in Mcp-Session-Id header
                  2. Reject invalid session IDs with 404 Not Found
                  3. Maintain session state across requests
                  4. Handle missing session IDs appropriately

                  Without proper session persistence:
                  - Stateful operations become impossible
                  - Each request is treated independently
                  - Complex multi-step workflows cannot function
                  - User context is lost between requests
